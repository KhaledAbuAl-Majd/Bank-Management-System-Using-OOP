## Overview  
This project is a Bank Management System developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles (C++). The system simulates a banking application allowing users to manage clients, perform transactions, and handle user accounts efficiently.  

## Features  
- **User Authentication**: Secure login system with encrypted passwords.  
- **Client Management**: Options to add, delete, update, and find client information.  
- **Transaction Management**: Users can deposit, withdraw, and transfer funds, check total balances, and view transaction logs.  
- **User Management**: Administrators can manage user accounts, including listing, adding, deleting, and updating user details.
